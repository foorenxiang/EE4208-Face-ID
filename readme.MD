## Face Detection using PCA with People and Expression Classifiers

### Real-time detection implementing:
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  - Nearest Neighbour Classifier (SSD)
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  
### Video demos:
- Nearest Neighbour Classifier (SSD)
  - Extreme recognition of single person
    - https://youtu.be/bO-e7UspUXU 
  - Recognition of people within and outside the recognised list. Tested using people found on Google Images
    - https://youtu.be/kXa6aWl-G8w
- Support Vector Machine Classifer (SVM)
  - Demo oriented around extreme recognition of single person
    - https://youtu.be/Zb_AllFWQ64
  - Recognition of people within and outside the recognised list. Tested using people found on Google Images

Classifiers Tested during training step:
- Nearest Neighbour Classifier (SSD)
- Support Vector Machines
- Adaboost
- GradientBoost
- XGBoost
- Stack Generalizer
- Random Forest
- Histogram Gradient Boosting
- K-NN 
  
429 images of 83 people with varying expressions.
  
Images and video-stream are zero-meaned to deal with lighting changes.
  
SSD used to determine if person in frame is not within training set.

Due to privacy concerns, the training dataset and generated models are not included in this repository.  
To fit the PCA principal components and classification models, place your photos in a folder named `input`, with the notation: `person_expression.jpg`  
E.g. `./input/john_smiling.jpg`
